    	<h3>About me</h3>
    	<p>‚ÄúEverything is figure-out-able‚Äù</p>
    	<p>I live by this quote, it has built me into a competent problem solving human, it means that no matter how difficult a situation is, I would always find a way out.</p>
    	<p>My name is <span>Michael Shumaker</span>, you can also call me satoshi 16px. I am a multi-disciplinary UI/UX designer, I have been solving design problems for the past 7 years, solving web and mobile problems for over a year.</p>
    	<p>As a UI/UX designer the impact of a product on the product owner and the users is very important to me Empathy, Testing, iterations, simplicity, and asking why are always involved in my design process.</p>
    	<p>Being a designer with dyslexia is a struggle and as much as I struggle, it has helped me be more patient, empathetic, extremely meticulous in the details, have a minimalist approach in UI design and big on accessability.</p>
    	<p>I do however enjoy, researching, unconventional conversations, extreme sports, animes, cooking, and working without music.</p>
